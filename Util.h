/*
 * TRACE:     A normal ray-traced image. Nothing fancy.
 * SPHERE:    Does a lens trace through a spherical lens.
 * BICONCAVE: Does a lens trace through a biconcave lens.
 * BICONVEX:  Does a lens trace through a biconvex lens.
 * PCONCAVE:  Does a lens trace through a plano-concave lens.
 * PCONVEX:   Does a lens trace through a plano-convex lens.
 *
 * NOTE: Depth of field and stereo imaging can be enabled for each of these modes.
 *       For all lens tracing, DoF is very tricky to set as the lens reduces the effect.
