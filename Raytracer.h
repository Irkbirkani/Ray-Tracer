     * Render an image of the scene. Uses cameras[0] for the default camera.
     *     Arguments:
     *         z:         The depth of the image plane. Usually negative width.
     *         spheres:   A vector of Spheres in the scene.
     *         quads:     A vector of quads in the scene.
     *         light:     The lights position. Currently only supporting one light source.
     *         stereo:    Enables stereo image rendering.
     *         DoF:       Enables Depth of Field.
     *         samples:   The number of samples taken for DoF. Set to 1 if DoF is not enabled.
     *         file:      The filepath for the file you wish to write to. Must be a .ppm.
     *         traceType: The type of trace you wish to run.
     *                    Includes TRACE, SPHERE, PCONCAVE, BICONCAVE, PCONVEX, and BICONVEX.
     *                    See Util.h for destrictions of traceTypes.
