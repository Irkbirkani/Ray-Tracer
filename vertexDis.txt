Fc = F/(1-xF)

Fc = power corrected for vertex distance.
F  = original power.
x  = change in distance in meters.

Since most mesurements are performed at 12mm and the average distance between the cornea and the lens
of the VR head set is also 12mm, x will be the distance from the origin to the back of the lens in
in the virtual system.

Steps: 
    1. Ask for F.
    2. Find Fc.
    3. Use Fc in lensmaker's to find refraction Index.
    4. Change ri of lens and continue as normal.
